# ⛓️ Pendulum-v1 Reinforcement Learning Project  

Welcome to the **Pendulum-v1** reinforcement learning project! 🚀 This repository is part of my journey in **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, where I experiment with different algorithms to solve control problems.  

<br/>

## 🎯 Project Overview  

The goal of this project is to train an agent to balance and swing up a **pendulum** using reinforcement learning techniques. The **Pendulum-v1** environment is a classic control problem where the agent applies torque to keep the pendulum upright.  

- **Environment:** OpenAI Gym - Pendulum-v1  
- **Goal:** Minimize the angle deviation from the upright position  
- **Reward Function:** Penalizes deviations from the vertical and large control inputs  
- **Algorithm Used:** (To be updated) 🤖

## 🛠️ How to Run  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vedantLotankar/Reinforcement-Learning/pendulum-v1.git
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the training script:  
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```  
4. Evaluate the trained model:  
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

## 📈 Future Improvements  

- Experiment with different RL algorithms like **DDPG, PPO, SAC** 🎯  
- Tune hyperparameters for better stability and performance  
- Implement visualization tools to track training progress 📊
