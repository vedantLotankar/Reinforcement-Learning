# 🚀 Lunar Lander DQN Reinforcement Learning Model  

Welcome to the Lunar Lander DQN Model repository! 🎉 This project is a part of my Reinforcement Learning journey, where I explore deep Q-learning techniques to solve the Lunar Lander environment.

<br/>

## 🎯 Project Overview  

The objective of this project is to train an agent to land a lunar module safely on the designated landing pad using reinforcement learning techniques. The **LunarLander-v3** environment is a well-known RL problem where an agent controls the lander's thrusters to achieve a smooth landing.  

- **Environment:** OpenAI Gym - LunarLander-v3  
- **Goal:** Land the module safely while minimizing fuel usage  
- **Reward Function:** Provides positive rewards for a soft landing and penalties for crashes or drifting away  
- **Algorithm Used:** DQN

## 🛠️ How to Run  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vedantLotankar/reinforcement-learning/LunarLander-v3.git
   ```   

<br/>

## 📈 Future Improvements  

- Experiment with different RL algorithms like **DQN, PPO, A2C** 🎯  
- Tune hyperparameters for better stability and efficiency  
- Implement visualization tools to track training progress 📊
